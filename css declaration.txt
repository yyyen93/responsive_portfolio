BEM (Block Element Modifier):

BEM is one of the most widely used naming conventions. It divides class names into three parts: Block, Element, and Modifier.
Block: Represents a high-level component or module (e.g., .button).
Element: Represents a part or subcomponent of the block (e.g., .button__text).
Modifier: Represents variations or different states of a block or element (e.g., .button--primary).
